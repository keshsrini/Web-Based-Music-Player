# Simple Web-Based Music Player

A basic web-based music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to create a simple audio player using standard web technologies.

## Features

- Plays audio files in the browser.
- Includes basic styling and functionality.
- Built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for optional interactivity.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-music-player.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd web-music-player
    ```

3. **Add your music file:**

    Place your `music.mp3` file in the root directory of the project. Ensure the file name matches the one specified in the `index.html` file.

4. **Open the project:**

    You can open `index.html` directly in your browser. Alternatively, you can use a local server. If you have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code, right-click on `index.html` and select `Open with Live Server`.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the music player.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the music player.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for additional functionality.
- `music.mp3`: The audio file used for playback (make sure to add your own).

## Usage

- **Play/Pause**: Use the built-in controls of the audio element to play or pause the music.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume using the volume slider in the audio controls.
